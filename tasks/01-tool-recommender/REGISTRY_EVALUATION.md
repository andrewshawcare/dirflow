# MCP Registry Evaluation

## Evaluated Registries

### 1. Smithery MCP Registry
- **URL**: https://smithery.ai/
- **API Access**: REST API at registry.smithery.ai
- **Tool Coverage**: 8,000+ MCP servers across diverse categories
- **Data Quality**: High - verified deployments with comprehensive metadata
- **Authentication**: Optional API key for enhanced access (works without for basic queries)
- **Pros**: Massive collection, verified deployments, rich metadata, active ecosystem
- **Cons**: Newer platform, some servers may be experimental

### 2. Anthropic MCP Servers Repository
- **URL**: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers
- **API Access**: GitHub API for repository content
- **Tool Coverage**: ~30 official MCP servers
- **Data Quality**: High - official implementations with standardized schemas
- **Authentication**: GitHub API (optional token for higher rate limits)
- **Pros**: Official source, well-documented, high quality
- **Cons**: Limited number of tools, primarily Anthropic-maintained

### 3. MCP Awesome List
- **URL**: https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers
- **API Access**: GitHub API for repository content
- **Tool Coverage**: 50+ curated MCP servers
- **Data Quality**: Curated list with descriptions
- **Authentication**: GitHub API (optional token)
- **Pros**: Curated selection, good descriptions
- **Cons**: Manual curation lag, limited metadata

## Selected Registry: Smithery MCP Registry

### Selection Rationale
The Smithery MCP Registry was selected as the primary registry for this implementation based on the following factors:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 8,000+ MCP servers providing extensive tool diversity
2. **Rich Metadata**: Each server includes detailed descriptions, verification status, and deployment information
3. **REST API**: Clean, well-documented API with flexible querying capabilities
4. **Verification System**: Deployed and verified servers ensure reliability
5. **No Authentication Required**: Basic queries work without API keys
6. **Active Ecosystem**: Large, growing collection with real-world usage statistics

### API Implementation Details
- **Endpoint**: `https://registry.smithery.ai/servers`
- **Query Parameters**: `q` (search), `page`, `pageSize`, filtering options
- **Rate Limit**: Reasonable limits for public access
- **Data Format**: JSON responses with server metadata (qualifiedName, displayName, description, etc.)
- **Cost**: Free for basic registry queries
- **Reliability**: Modern infrastructure with good uptime

### Limitations and Considerations
- Newer platform compared to GitHub-based alternatives
- Quality may vary across the large collection of servers
- Some servers may be experimental or less mature
- Requires internet connectivity for real-time registry access

This selection prioritizes comprehensive tool coverage and real-world MCP server ecosystem representation, making it ideal for demonstrating intelligent tool recommendation across diverse use cases.
