# Implementation Notes

## Reduction Patterns Discussion

The `data-processing` example revealed a need for better reduction/aggregation patterns in dirflow. The original example attempted to use a while loop with a condition that would cause infinite loops, highlighting that:

1. **Reduction operations** (like counting, summing, averaging) need special handling
2. **Stateful aggregation** across loop iterations isn't currently well-supported
3. **Loop termination conditions** for reductions need careful design

### Potential Solutions to Explore:
- Dedicated reduction control structures
- Built-in aggregation functions 
- Better loop condition evaluation that preserves data flow
- Stateful variables across iterations
